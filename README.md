# MSc Thesis – 3D Water Temperature Simulation in Lake Vättern

This repository contains my MSc thesis project in Geomatics at Lund University.  
The project focuses on simulating **3D water temperature dynamics** in Lake Vättern using **Delft3D Flow**.  
Telemetry data was evaluated both as validation data and as input to the model.  

## 📂 Structure
- `src/` – Python scripts for processing ERA5 land hourly and single level data, as well as telemetry datasets  
- `docs/` – Thesis report (PDF) explaining background, methodology, and results  

## ⚠️ Note
The code is intentionally over-commented for educational purposes.  
For production use, comments should follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines.  

## 🔧 Methods
- Preprocessing of ERA5 climate reanalysis data  
- Integration and evaluation of telemetry data  
- 3D hydrodynamic simulation with Delft3D Flow  
- Model validation against observed temperature profiles  

## 🎓 Context
Originally developed as part of my MSc thesis in Geomatics at Lund University.
